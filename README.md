# MSSA-Project
[Check out the prototype!](https://meme-me.azurewebsites.net/)

This is the start of a web app where anyone can upload memes to a site, essentially anonymously, and it can be filtered by only those posted nearby.
Currently, if a user does not consent to sharing their location, the default location is in the middle of the Bermuda triangle.
Also, when a user clicks the local button, everything posted within 1 degree latitude and longitude are displayed to them. I would like to make that a dynamic range.

## Home View
This is how the users are greeted

## Local View
Location data is sent to the server via the url and then processed server side

## Add Modal
This pops up when a user wants to upload a meme, and dissapears if they click anywhere outside of the box

## Database Stuff
This is the current state of my database. Simple. Elegant.
